Code ideas from:

Used in colab.

Some relevant points:
The datasets are pretty big, so its necessary to downgrade the size of the files.

It does not have a very good feature reduction, it only eliminates the columns with over 90% of Nan values. but it requires an improvements
as a correleation of features to get the most relevant.

It takes randoms values from the "isFraud == 0" and equals the amount of values to the "isFraud" amaount. This is done becuase it has 
very few fraud cases.
